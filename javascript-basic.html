    <h1>Javascript</h1>
    <p>Javascript is a coding language used to create interactive effects between the user and the computer.</p>
    
    <p>As you can see, the function of the code is to show the results when you add, subtract, multiply, and divide 2 numbers. This is just one of many instances that javascript can be implemented into websites.</p>
